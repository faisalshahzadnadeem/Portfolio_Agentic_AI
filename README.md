# Medical Imaging Diagnosis Agent

## Overview

This project implements a **Medical Imaging Diagnosis Agent** powered by the **Agno** framework and **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash**. The agent assists healthcare professionals by analyzing medical images such as X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, and ultrasounds to provide:

- Image type identification  
- Anatomical region detection  
- Key findings and potential abnormalities  
- Image quality assessment  
- AI-assisted explanations with references  

The project includes a Streamlit-based UI for uploading images and receiving instant diagnostic insights.

## Features

- Supports multiple medical imaging modalities  
- Uses AI for expert-level image analysis  
- Performs image quality checks using OpenCV  
- Integrates Google Gemini LLM for natural language explanations  
- Easy-to-use Streamlit web interface
